**DiscordChatExporter** is an application that can be used to export message history from any [Discord](https://discord.com) channel to a file.
It works with direct messages, group messages, and server channels, and supports Discord's dialect of markdown as well as most other rich media features.

> **Important**:
> To run **DiscordChatExporter**, you need to make sure that the **.NET 8.0 Runtime** is installed.
> You can download it here:
>
> - [.NET 8.0 Runtime for **macOS x64**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.0-macos-x64-installer)
> - [.NET 8.0 Runtime for **macOS arm64**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.0-macos-arm64-installer)
> - [.NET 8.0 Runtime for **Linux**](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/install/linux) (find the correct download for your distro)
> - On **Windows**, the runtime should be installed automatically when you run the application for the first time
>
> This should not be necessary if you install **DiscordChatExporter** using a package manager, as it should take care of the dependencies for you.
> This is also not necessary if you are running **DiscordChatExporter** via Docker, because the image already contains the runtime.
